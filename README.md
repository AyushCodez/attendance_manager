# Attendance_manager
This code was created to read froma zoom chatbox and return an excel sheet of the identification number and name to mark attendance

The data entered into the chat has to be in the form 'identification number_name' or 'identification number-name' to be recognised. Each participant can enter this when they join the call.

Then at the end of the call can download the chats and enter the file path in the programe along with some other details. The program then processes the data and creates an excel file with the help of the openpyxl module
